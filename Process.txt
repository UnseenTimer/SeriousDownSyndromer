0) IMPORTANT! increate the version number in SDSAppUpdate.cs first and compile new code
1) Place all new files into `SDSBase` and zip that into a `SDSUpdate.zip`
2) Just put all the new files in there, it copy all of that into the project base folder overriding existing files.

Yeah, at some point I might need to make script to remove unused files
